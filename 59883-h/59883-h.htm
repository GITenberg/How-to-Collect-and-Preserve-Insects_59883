<h1 title=""><span class="smaller">HOW TO COLLECT AND PRESERVE INSECTS</span></h1>
<p class="jr1"><b>H. H. ROSS</b></p>
<p>With rather simple equipment, the amateur as well as the
trained entomologist can make a worthwhile collection of insects.</p>
<p>The making of such a collection may have educational and recreational
as well as scientific values. Developing this hobby is one of the
finest ways for students, especially those in agricultural districts, to
become acquainted with the large number of injurious and beneficial
insects that they encounter about the home and in the fields. High
school classes in biology find excellent laboratory material in the many
insects available for rearing and study. Both old and young collectors
find a great deal of pleasure in working with the showy and beautiful
insects, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies; the satisfaction derived
comes both from having relaxation from the day&rsquo;s work and from
making real contributions to scientific knowledge. Many entomological
museums welcome the opportunity to examine carefully prepared
and labeled collections. These collections supply distribution records
for insect species, in addition to other information of value to technical
entomologists. Also, the amateur collector profits from his
contact with specialists who can help him identify his specimens and
advise him at any stage of his work.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this circular will show how easy it is to make a
start in insect collecting and will give the student helpful ideas on
how and where to begin.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">WHERE TO COLLECT</span></h2>
<p>In late spring, in summer, and in early fall, insects are very
abundant in fields and woods, and large numbers of them may be
caught by sweeping through the grass and branches with a strong
insect net. Flowers of all descriptions are favorite visiting places of
many bees, flies, beetles, and other insects, and will afford good collecting.
Woods along the banks of streams, open glades in deep woods,
and brush along forest edges offer some of the best opportunities for
collecting by the sweeping method.</p>
<p>In early spring, when insects can be taken only sparingly in the
open, the collector frequently finds sheltered hollows where they may
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
be caught in large numbers. A certain kind of insect may live only
on a certain kind of plant, and to obtain the insect the collector must
search or sweep the plant, called the host plant.</p>
<p>Many obscure places harbor insects seldom found elsewhere.
Among these are leaf mold and debris on the surface of the soil,
particularly in woods; rotten logs and stumps, which should be turned
over to reveal insects that hide under or around them, and then carefully
searched or torn apart for others that live inside; in, under, and
around dead animals; under boards and stones.</p>
<p>Trees sometimes yield valuable specimens. If part of a tree, under
which has been spread a large white sheet, is struck with a heavy,
padded stick, many insects, such as weevils, will fall to the sheet and
&ldquo;play possum.&rdquo; They can be picked off quite easily.</p>
<p>Lights attract large numbers of certain nocturnal insects, such
as June beetles and many kinds of moths; at night these insects may
be collected at street or porch lights, on windows and screens of
lighted rooms, or at light traps put up especially to attract them.
Swarms of aquatic insects come to street lights of towns along
rivers, sometimes in such numbers as to pile up in a crawling mass
under each light. Collecting at this source is best on warm, cloudy
nights; wind or cold keeps most nocturnal insects fairly inactive.
Different species of moths and beetles visit the lights in different
seasons so that collecting by this method alone yields many kinds of
insects.</p>
<p>Insects that live in the water may be collected with heavy dip
nets swept through the water at various levels and through the mud
and debris at the bottom. In shallow water, many insects will be
found if stones and logs are turned over and leaf tufts pulled apart.</p>
<p>In winter, insect galls or cocoons may be gathered. If these are
placed in jars with cheesecloth covers tied over them, kept in a warm
room, but away from radiators and all intense heat, many insects
will emerge from them before spring.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">WHAT TO USE</span></h2>
<p>For making even a fairly large insect collection, only a small
amount of equipment is required. A net and killing bottle are essential,
and good work may be done with these alone. A greater variety of insects
may be collected and with better results if a few more items are
added to the list. Here is an outfit that will be found very satisfactory
in the field.</p>
<p>1. A strong beating net for general sweeping and an additional
light net to be used for moths and butterflies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>2. Killing bottles, several small and one or two large ones.</p>
<p>3. A pair of flexible forceps, 10 to 12 centimeters (about 4 to 5
inches) long, with slender prongs.</p>
<p>4. One or two camel&rsquo;s-hair brushes for picking up minute insects.</p>
<p>5. A few vials or small bottles containing fluid preservative.</p>
<p>6. Folded papers for butterflies.</p>
<p>7. A few small tins or boxes lined with cellucotton.</p>
<p>These items may be purchased from commercial supply houses
such as those listed on <a href="#Page_71">page 71</a>. Many items, however, may be made
by the collector at nominal cost.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Nets</h3>
<p>Nets are the most important items in the collecting kit of the
entomologist. For this reason nets should be rigidly constructed and
handled with care.</p>
<p><b>Construction.</b>&mdash;Nets may easily be made at home. The necessary
parts are a handle, a loop or ring to be attached to it, and a cloth
bag to be hung from the loop, figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>. The handle should be
strong and fairly light. At the net end, <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a><i>a</i>, a groove is cut down
each side to receive the arms of the loop. The grooves are as deep as
the thickness of the wire used in the loop; one groove is 3 inches long
and the other 2&frac12; inches; and each ends in a hole through the handle
at right angles to the length.</p>
<p>The loop, <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a><i>b</i>, is made of steel wire, preferably three-eighths-inch
piano wire, which if bent by rough usage springs back into shape
and will stand a great deal of hard wear. The wire is shaped, as the
figure shows, to form a loop with two straight arms, the tips of which
are bent at right angles toward each other. The arms and hooks thus
formed must be exactly long enough to fit along the grooves and into
the holes in the handle. After the bag or net has been attached to
the loop, and the wire has been fitted to the handle, the joint may
either be wrapped tightly with wire, <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a><i>c</i>, or bound by a metal
cylinder or ferrule slipped over the arms of the loop, <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a><i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The bag, about twice as long as the diameter of the loop, should
be tapered at the bottom. It is made from four pieces of cloth, each
cut in the shape of <a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a><i>a</i>, and a narrow strip or band of stout muslin
or light canvas, <a href="#fig2">2</a><i>b</i>, which is to bind the bag to the wire loop. The four
pieces are sewed together to form a cone-shaped bag, and one edge
of the band is sewed to the top edge of the bag.</p>
<p>The bag may be attached to the wire loop in either of two ways.
The band may be folded over the loop and sewed so that the attachment
is permanent; or it may be folded over, sewed, and then slipped
on the loop before the latter is fastened to the handle. In the latter
case the bag must be open along one seam just below the handle a
sufficient distance to allow the band to slip on and around the loop;
this vent may be closed with a string lacing after the net is on the
loop, and the whole fastened to the handle. A combination of this
arrangement with a ferrule binding the loop to the handle is most
convenient, for it allows the bag to be removed at will and a lighter
or heavier one substituted according to the needs of the collector.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;Net loop and handle. The short grooves cut opposite each other at
the small end of the handle, <i>a</i>, end in holes through the handle that receive the
hooks of the loop arms, <i>b</i>. The loop may be permanently bound to the handle with
wire, <i>c</i>, or a removable joint may be effected with a metal ferrule that can be
slipped up and down, <i>d</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;Bag and completed net. The bag is cut from four pieces shaped as in <i>a</i>,
and the top edge of the bag is bound with a narrow strip of stout muslin or light
canvas, <i>b</i>, by means of which the bag is attached to the loop. After the bag is on
the loop, the back vent may be closed with a string lacing, as shown in the figure.
This closing, which keeps the back of the net from gaping, prevents the escape
of the most active insects through the back opening. The handle pictured here is
a removable type, <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a><i>d</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p><i>General Purpose Net.</i>&mdash;Loop, heavy wire, 12 inches in diameter;
bag, strong unbleached muslin or light duck, 20 to 24 inches long;
handle, hardwood stick, 24 to 30 inches long.</p>
<p><i>Butterfly Net.</i>&mdash;As above but with a longer handle and a bag of
good quality marquisette or fine nylon netting.</p>
<p><i>Combination Net.</i>&mdash;A net that includes the features and uses of
the two nets described above and is a better collecting instrument
may be conveniently made instead, although at slightly higher cost
because of the better materials. Its loop, of 7&frac12; gauge (three-eighths
inch) piano wire, is 15 inches in diameter and allows a greater area
to be covered with each sweep. The bag, of finest bolter&rsquo;s silk or best
quality marquisette, is 24 inches long and serves equally well for the
capture of delicate insects and for beating. The handle, of straight-grained
hickory or ash, is 40 inches long and permits the collector to
cover greater areas in sweeping. If a cheaper net is desired, one of
unbleached muslin will be satisfactory for general use.</p>
<p><b>Care and Use.</b>&mdash;All nets are easily ripped and for this reason
should be kept away from barbed wire and from thorny trees, such as
locust and red haw. Also, they should be kept dry. Moisture rots the
fabric, making it more easily torn. Most insects caught in a net while
it is wet are unfit for a collection.</p>
<p>Flowers, herbs, and boughs should be swept with a sidewise
motion. A sidewise sweep will collect more insects than an upward
or downward sweep and at the same time mutilate less. If care is
taken not to damage flowers or foliage, the same patch of plants may
be visited several times with profit. The contents of the bag should
be removed after every few sweeps or strokes. This practice will
prevent damage to the insects caused by being jostled about in the
net with a large amount of debris.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Killing Bottles</h3>
<p>The best killing agents for use in bottles are either potassium
cyanide or calcium cyanide. These compounds give a concentration
of deadly fumes sufficient to kill most insects in a very short time,
which is desirable. Generally, two sizes of bottles are used, and in
either of them one of these cyanides may give good results. Only a
small supply should be purchased at a time, as they deteriorate rapidly.</p>
<p><b>Construction.</b>&mdash;A pyrex glass test tube or strong ring-necked vial,
about three-quarters inch wide and 4 to 6 inches long, makes a good
cyanide bottle of the smaller size, <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>. Put about three-quarters
inch of granular potassium cyanide or calcium cyanide flakes in the
tube or vial. Cover with a tight plug of cellucotton, on top of which
put one or two loose plugs. Instead of cellucotton, you may use sawdust
and a plaster of Paris batter. In the latter case, cover the cyanide
with one-quarter inch of sawdust and over it pour one-quarter inch
of newly mixed, thick batter of plaster of Paris and water. Allow the
batter to harden for a few hours; then keep the bottle tightly corked
except when it is being used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;Cyanide killing bottles. The lethal chemical, 1, is potassium cyanide
or calcium cyanide and is covered with a layer of cellucotton, 2, or sawdust, 3, and
plaster of Paris, 4. The rest of the bottle is filled with soft, loosely crumpled, lint-free
paper, which should be changed whenever it gets damp. The bottles should be
tightly corked and labeled POISON. The collector should <i>not</i> test their strength
by smelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The larger cyanide bottle, <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>, which should be sturdy, may
range in capacity from one-half pint to a quart. <i>In the larger bottle,
the cyanide should always have the plaster of Paris covering.</i> The
layer of sawdust and plaster should be a little thicker than that for
the smaller bottle.</p>
<p><b>Care and Use.</b>&mdash;Label all killing bottles and other containers of
cyanide conspicuously with the word <b>POISON</b>; keep them tightly
corked and away from children or adults who do not realize the extreme
deadliness of the compounds. <i>Never test the strength of a killing
bottle by taking the cork out and smelling the contents.</i> As an
added precaution and safeguard to the collector, tape the bottom of
the cyanide bottle to protect it against breakage.</p>
<p>The bottle should be almost entirely filled with loosely crumpled,
soft paper, which should be changed whenever it gets damp. This
paper will help keep the specimens from rubbing against each other
inside the bottle and thereby being damaged.</p>
<p>Each collector should have several cyanide bottles and follow
carefully these practices.</p>
<p>1. Transfer insects from net to bottle by holding the uncorked
bottle in a fold or corner of the net and crowding one or more of
the specimens into it, or &ldquo;running&rdquo; the open bottle up the side of the
net beneath the specimen or specimens. Most insects can be maneuvered
into the bottle easily and the opening temporarily closed by the
thumb, or the stopper can be put on. In obstinate cases, it may be
desirable to stopper the bottle through the cloth of the net until the
specimen is stupefied, after which the insect will drop to the bottom
of the bottle.</p>
<p>2. Keep small, delicate insects in a bottle by themselves. Such
insects as large beetles are apt to mutilate small flies and other
delicate insects in the same bottle.</p>
<p>3. Keep a special bottle for moths and butterflies. When these
die they shed large quantities of scales, which stick to and partially
spoil other insects.</p>
<p>4. Keep the inside of the bottle dry. Cyanide bottles &ldquo;sweat&rdquo;;
that is, moisture both from the insects and the plaster condenses on
the inside of the bottle. Moisture will mat the hair and appendages
of insects and discolor the bodies. Do not crowd the bottle with large
insects, especially juicy ones like grasshoppers. Change the paper
frequently. Wipe out the bottle with paper or cloth, which should be
carefully disposed of in such a way that it cannot poison persons or
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
pets. Keep the killing chemical out of cuts and mouth. Wash hands
with care after handling the chemical.</p>
<p>5. Take insects out of the bottles soon after they are dead.
Cyanide fumes quickly turn many yellows to red or orange, and also
make small specimens brittle so that legs and other parts break off
easily.</p>
<p>6. Empty the insects out of the bottles before they have accumulated
in a ball at the bottom. To do so will prevent damage to the
smaller specimens and discoloration due to &ldquo;sweating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7. Dispose of a cyanide bottle when it will no longer kill insects
quickly. Substitute a fresh bottle and you will save time in the field.
Be sure to dispose of old bottles in such a way that their deadly contents
are out of reach of children and pets.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Aspirators or Suckers</h3>
<p>Small, rapidly moving insects, such as leafhoppers, diminutive
beetles, and flies, may be collected by using an aspirator or sucker,
figs. <a href="#fig4">4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a>.</p>
<p><b>Construction.</b>&mdash;An aspirator can be made from a capsule vial
(available from a drugstore) or from a piece of glass tubing. A small
olive bottle may be substituted for the vial.</p>
<p>The following items are needed for the vial aspirator, <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>: a
vial, 1&frac14; inches in diameter and 3 or more inches long, a two-hole
rubber stopper with openings to fit one-fourth-inch diameter glass
tubing, 16 inches of one-fourth-inch diameter glass tubing, rubber
tubing 24 inches long to fit over the glass tubing, a small metal file
(the triangular type is best), a small piece of cheesecloth, some string,
and a bunsen burner. Construct the vial aspirator according to the
following directions and as shown in <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>.</p>
<p>1. Cut the glass tubing into three pieces, 3 inches, 8 inches, and
5 inches in length. To cut the tubing, score it with an edge of the
metal file; then hold the tubing with both hands so that the thumb
of each hand is on the side of the tubing opposite to the scored mark;
break the tubing away from the body by exerting pressure with the
thumbs.</p>
<p>2. Make a slight bend in the center of the 8-inch piece of tubing
and a right angle bend in the 5-inch piece, as follows: hold one piece
of glass tubing with both hands and place the center of it in the blue
flame of the bunsen burner; rotate the tubing slowly. When the glass
glows yellow, it begins to soften. Bend the tubing to the desired angle.
Then quickly withdraw the tubing from the flame.</p>
<p>3. Heat one end of the 8-inch piece of glass tubing in the bunsen
burner, slowly rotating the tubing so that the sharp edges melt
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
slightly and round out; then allow the tubing to cool. Heat one end of
the 3-inch tubing in the same manner. Smooth the remaining rough
edges of the glass tubing by heating them slightly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 5.&mdash;Tubing type of aspirator. Parts for this aspirator should be compared
with equivalent parts for the aspirator shown in <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>. Noted especially
should be the position of the glass tube, <i>c</i>, and the length of the rubber tube, <i>f</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>4. Insert the 8-inch and 5-inch pieces of glass tubing into the
rubber stopper. The longer piece, <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a><i>c</i>, should project about 1&frac12;
inches into the vial. The shorter piece, <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a><i>d</i>, should project about
three-fourths inch.</p>
<p>5. Over one end of the 5-inch piece of glass tubing, <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a><i>e</i>, tie
two thicknesses of cheesecloth securely with string.</p>
<p>6. Over the other end of the 5-inch piece, slip one end of the
rubber tubing, <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a><i>f</i>.</p>
<p>7. Into the other end of the rubber tubing slip the 3-inch piece of
glass tubing, <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a><i>g</i>, so that the rounded end of glass is exposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>8. Complete the assembly of the aspirator by placing the rubber
stopper snugly into the vial. The vial aspirator is now ready for use.</p>
<p>If a piece of glass tubing 1&frac14; inches in diameter and 8 inches
long is available, then a tube aspirator can be made, <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>. In making
a tube aspirator, use two one-hole rubber stoppers, <a href="#fig5">5</a><i>b</i>. Cut the pieces
of glass tubing as shown in <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a><i>c</i>, <a href="#fig5">5</a><i>e</i>, and <a href="#fig5">5</a><i>g</i>. Using a piece of rubber
tubing, <a href="#fig5">5</a><i>f</i>, complete the minor details as described for the vial aspirator,
not forgetting the cheesecloth, <a href="#fig5">5</a><i>e</i>, and assemble the parts as
shown in <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>.</p>
<p><b>Use and Care.</b>&mdash;To catch an insect with the aspirator shown in
<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a> or <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>, put end piece, <i>g</i>, in your mouth, grasp the vial or tube,
<i>a</i>, in your dexterous hand, aim the intake tube, <i>c</i>, at the insect and
almost touching it; suck suddenly and hard. The air current pulls the
insect in; the insect usually does not find its way into the intake tube
to crawl out. The cheesecloth, <i>e</i>, prevents the insect from being sucked
into your mouth.</p>
<p>To kill insects in the aspirator, use a small cyanide bottle, <a href="#fig4">4</a><i>i</i>,
which is inserted in a cork, <a href="#fig4">4</a><i>h</i>, that has been partially bored through
to receive it. This cork should be the exact size of the vial or tube
for which it is intended.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p05b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="368" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 6.&mdash;Sifter with hand grips. Debris containing insects is sifted over a
piece of white oilcloth. The sifter, not more than half full, is shaken gently at
first and then violently. Finally the debris that cannot be shaken through the sifter
is emptied on the oilcloth, and specimens too large to go through the mesh of the
sifter are captured. Patience is required to get the best results with the sifter,
which provides one of the best methods for winter collecting.</p>
</div>
<p>To use the cyanide cork with the vial aspirator shown in <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>,
simply exchange the corks. If the glass tube aspirator is used, plug
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
the intake tube, 5<i>c</i>, with a tapered paper plug or a leaf, jar the insects
away from the stopper at the opposite end, remove this stopper
cautiously, and quickly insert in its place the cyanide cork. When the
specimens are stupefied, they may be transferred to another bottle.</p>
<p>The cyanide corks are highly poisonous. Between times of use
with an aspirator, keep each of these corks inserted tightly in a bottle
or vial labeled &ldquo;POISON,&rdquo; as in <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Sifter</h3>
<p>Perhaps no special collecting method results in more interesting,
rare, and diverse kinds of insects than that involved in sifting rotten
logs, leaf mold, and other forest and prairie ground cover. To do this
type of collecting, provide yourself with the following:</p>
<p>1. A stout sifting sieve about 12 by 12 inches and 4 to 6 inches
deep, <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>. The bottom may be wire screen of any desired mesh;
usually 8, 10, or 12 meshes to the inch give good results.</p>
<p>2. A sturdy piece of white oilcloth about 18 inches or 2 feet
square.</p>
<p>3. Collecting equipment, including an aspirator, camel&rsquo;s-hair
brush, forceps, vials, and killing bottle.</p>
<p>Material such as leaf mold is placed in the sieve and this is
shaken over the white oilcloth, which has been spread on a level spot
on the ground. The small insects fall on the cloth and can be picked
up with the aspirator or the camel&rsquo;s-hair brush. Many insects feign
death when they fall to the oilcloth and they are difficult to detect in
the bits of sifted material until they &ldquo;revive&rdquo; and start to move.</p>
<p>In late fall and winter, sifting provides one of the most profitable
types of collecting; in any season, it will turn up such things as rare
spiders and beetles. Sifting is most successful for finding large,
active insects. For small, slow-moving forms, Berlese funnels offer a
better collecting method.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Berlese Funnel</h3>
<p>When you are wandering through woods or fields, do you realize
that you are stepping on more insects than you ever see? The ground
cover and soil are inhabited by a vast assemblage of little animals
that are seldom seen by the casual collector. Because many of these
animals are exceedingly minute, they are difficult to see and collect by
ordinary methods.</p>
<p><b>Construction.</b>&mdash;The most efficient method for collecting this fauna
is by the use of Berlese funnels, named after the Italian entomologist
Berlese (pronounced Bur-lazy), who first used them extensively. A
Berlese funnel is a very simple apparatus, consisting of a fairly long
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
funnel, suspended wide end up, with, a screen placed about a third
of the way down the funnel; heat is applied either around the upper
portion or over the top of the funnel, and a container of preservative,
preferably 80 per cent ethyl alcohol, is placed at the small bottom
opening. Leaf mold or other material is placed on the screen, the
heat source is turned on, and soon the animals begin to leave the
drying sample and migrate downward, dropping into the preservative.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="505" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 7.&mdash;Diagrammatic cross section of a Berlese funnel. The central figure
shows an arrangement for a steam coil, the lower left for an electric light.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> illustrates a funnel that has proved very satisfactory; it is
15 inches from top to bottom, and the top has a diameter of 12 inches.
The bottom opening, seven-eighths inch in diameter, fits into the
mouth of the bottle containing the preservative. Three angled brackets
or hangers are soldered inside the funnel to provide a rest for the
screen, which is made of quarter-inch or eighth-inch mesh hardware
cloth; the mesh used depends upon the type of sample. A battery of
several funnels in a rack, <a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>, will allow the collector to sample
several kinds of material at the same time.</p>
<p>If steam is used as a source of heat, the small copper lines that
conduct it act as a partial support for the funnel by encircling it about
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
halfway between the screen and the top; a piece of cloth is tied tightly
over the top of the funnel to prevent the upward escape of animals.
If an electric light is used for heating, it should be hung directly over
the center of the funnel, no cloth should be tied over the top, and the
light should have a reflector nearly as wide as the top of the funnel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="658" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 8.&mdash;Berlese funnel in position on rack. Each funnel rests inside a double
ring of copper tubing (visible at extreme lower left), through which live steam
flows. The steam produces heat that dries out the sample of leaf mold in the funnel
and drives animals into a bottle of preservative below. Cotton or a small rag is
tamped between the end of the funnel and the mouth of the bottle to prevent
escape of specimens.</p>
</div>
<p>Care must be taken not to heat the sample too rapidly. Otherwise,
either moisture will condense in the lower part of the funnel and trap
many of the animals working their way toward the bottom, or the
heat will kill many of the organisms before they have an opportunity
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
to move out of the sample. An application of heat sufficient to dry the
sample in 4 or 5 days is usually satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Berlese funnel is extremely useful for collecting many groups
of beetles (particularly Staphylinidae), thrips, springtails, many
groups of parasitic Hymenoptera, ants, mites, pseudoscorpions, millipedes,
centipedes, and a wide range of other minute animals that
live in soil, surface cover, logs, or bark.</p>
<p><b>Collecting Berlese Samples.</b>&mdash;Many different habitats and micro-habitats
provide good samples for the Berlese funnel. You will find
that, for general collecting, various types of ground cover are excellent;
for leaf mold samples, scrape off and discard the dry surface
leaves and scoop up the lower, rotted layers of leaves together with
an inch or two of the adjacent soil. You may encounter especially good
samples where leaves have blown in along the edge of a log. In such
a situation, take some of the log bark with the sample. Collect rotten
log samples in large hunks and break them up just before putting
them in the funnel. From either standing stumps or fallen logs in
which the wood is still too hard to break up, collect the loose bark,
as it is often quite productive. Frequently, if you roll a log over, you
may find animal runs under it; the debris and earth under and around
these runs, together with animal nests, frequently give unusual
catches, such as larvae and adults of fleas and rare ticks. Especially
productive are samples taken from the interior of a standing hollow
tree; from the bottom of the hollow you can scoop out a foot or more
of fine, rotten, woody material rich in rare insects.</p>
<p>Certain items placed in the funnel may produce distinctive and
unusual catches. Recently deserted birds&rsquo; nests will give mites and,
frequently, rare beetles, flies, and their larvae; mature or overmature
mushrooms and bracket fungi are often rich in beetles, thrips, and
maggots; bark of living trees may produce unusual thrips, springtails,
and psocids; debris from aquatic habitats and from the wet edges
of ponds and tiny streams may be productive of rare aquatic and
semiaquatic forms. Moss is a good source of peculiar species of
springtails, thrips, and beetles; the moss should be rolled up carefully
while being transported.</p>
<p><b>Handling Berlese Collections.</b>&mdash;In the field, put samples of leaf
mold or other material in tightly woven cloth bags or strong paper
bags for transportation. It is convenient to have small paper bags
for mushrooms, nests, and other small items, and larger bags for
ground cover, moss, and the like. When collecting ground cover and
similar material, put in each bag enough of a sample so that it will
not shake around loosely, but do not pack it tightly. Be sure that
samples do not overheat while being transported.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Samples may be collected at any season. If collected during warm
weather, they should be taken to a laboratory and placed in the funnels
within a day or two; otherwise, considerable loss of population occurs
within the samples. If collected during cold weather, they may be
kept in cold storage for a week or two with little loss of fauna.</p>
<p>In putting material in the funnel, lay it carefully on the screen
to a depth of a few inches. Moss and sod should be placed upside
down in a single layer on the screen. In the case of dense material,
pile the sample chiefly around the sides of the funnel and leave an
opening in the middle, as shown in <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>. After the funnel is loaded,
place it in the rack, put the bottle of preservative under it, and apply
the heat.</p>
<p>By substituting a different kind of collecting bottle at the bottom
of the funnel, you may obtain live material for rearing. The exact
changes necessary to obtain live material will depend upon your ingenuity
and the type of material you desire.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Equipment for Collecting Aquatic Insects</h3>
<p>Hundreds of different kinds of insects are aquatic and offer rich
collecting possibilities. In all instances, the immature stage lives in
water, but in most of them the adult stage emerges on land or flies in
the air. For this reason several types of collecting are needed to
obtain a good sampling of aquatic insects.</p>
<p><b>Night Collecting of Adult Insects.</b>&mdash;Collecting at lights on warm,
cloudy nights, or warm nights without moonlight, gives best results.
Two simple methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Drive your car to a spot overlooking a stream or lake and turn on
the bright lights. Into a shallow pan, such as a pie pan, pour enough
alcohol to cover the bottom with one-eighth to one-fourth inch of
fluid. Hold the pan directly under a headlight. If aquatic insects are
on the wing, they will come to the light and eventually drop in the
fluid, which traps them. With a small piece of wet cardboard, you
can scrape the entire insect contents of the pan into a small bottle
of alcohol, which you should then label, giving date, name of collector,
and location.</p>
<p>Lights in signs and store windows (especially blue neon signs)
near fresh water attract large numbers of aquatic insects. You may
capture an insect easily by dipping an index finger in a bottle of
alcohol, &ldquo;scooping up&rdquo; the insect rapidly on the wet surface, and then
dipping it in the bottle. An aspirator also can be used with success.</p>
<p><b>Day Collecting of Adult Insects.</b>&mdash;During the day, aquatic insects
frequently rest on or under bridges, window ledges, and similar
places, and show a preference for dense trees in shaded situations.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
They are especially numerous in those spots where the heavily leaved
branches hang low over the water and form humid, protected areas in
the heat of the day. Here sweeping with a stout and fairly wide-mouthed
net is very effective. Aquatic insects may often be picked off
stones in such places, especially early in the season.</p>
<p><b>Collecting Larvae.</b>&mdash;Practically every stream or lake has some
aquatic insect larvae which may be collected by various methods,
some simple and others requiring specialized and complicated apparatus.
For general collecting, the following suggestions may be
of value:</p>
<p>1. Look under logs and stones. Search out crevices in them; some
insects hide away and demand of the collector a keen and careful
search.</p>
<p>2. Tear apart bunches of leaves, roots, and other debris that may
have piled up in front of a rock or log, or that may have accumulated
at the end of a root or branch dangling in the water.</p>
<p>3. Pick out bunches of aquatic plants and search through them
carefully.</p>
<p>4. Sift mud, sand, or gravel taken from the bottom of a lake or
stream. Remember that some insects build cases in which they hide
when disturbed. It takes a practiced eye to see a motionless case.
After an insect has dried out a little, it partially emerges from the
case and drags it along in search of water; moving in this way, it is
easy to see.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">HOW TO HANDLE UNMOUNTED SPECIMENS</span></h2>
<p>Soon after insects are killed they dry out, become very brittle,
and are damaged easily. Small, fragile insects especially are susceptible
to breakage and, when dry, break up readily into fragments.
Hard-shelled insects, such as beetles, may appear to be sufficiently
durable to withstand handling when dry, but even these insects have
fragile legs, antennae, and other parts which snap off readily when
handled dry. Newly killed material should be either mounted or put
in temporary storage before it has dried out. If collected material
dries out before it can be mounted or stored, it should be relaxed by
special techniques so that the specimens can again be handled without
danger of breakage.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Temporary Cases</h3>
<p>If it is not convenient to mount the specimens when they are
taken from the killing bottle, the moths and butterflies should be put
in <i>papers</i> and other insects in cellucotton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Papers are simply rectangular strips of paper of convenient size
folded as in <a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>. A moth or butterfly, with its wings folded, is
placed in a paper, the edges of which are then crimped over to lock it
shut.</p>
<p>For insects other than moths or butterflies, cardboard pillboxes
containing cellucotton make good temporary housing, <a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>. A layer
of cellucotton is laid in the bottom, a layer of insects placed on it, and
another layer of cellucotton placed over the insects. The lid should fit
fairly snugly over all. Cigar boxes and other boxes of like size also
may be used in the same way.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="550" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 9.&mdash;Papers. These are temporary means of keeping dragonflies, moths,
butterflies, and small insects of other kinds until they can be relaxed and mounted.
A rectangular piece of paper, of a size suited to the insect it is to contain, is folded
along the dotted lines and in the directions indicated by arrows, as shown in <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Great care must be taken that sufficient cellucotton is put in the
box to take up all moisture in the insect bodies. If the specimens are
large, they should be allowed to dry moderately uncovered before
being placed in cellucotton in storage containers. If insects become
damp in the containers they quickly mold or rot. The containers
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
should be wood or cardboard boxes, for they will not sweat, as will a
metal box. The insects should be packed tightly enough to prevent
their rolling around and breaking.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Relaxing Boxes and Jars</h3>
<p>At any desired time the dry specimens may be relaxed and
mounted. A relaxing box or jar is easily made. In the bottom of a
wide-mouthed jar with a screw-on lid, put an inch or two of clean
sand; saturate the sand with water containing a small amount of
phenol (carbolic acid) and place over it a piece of cork, cardboard,
or wood cut to fit the jar. Place the dry specimens on the cork or
other material, and cover the jar tightly with the screw-on lid. The
lid must be practically airtight. In a day or two the specimens will be
soft and pliable enough for pinning or spreading, the next steps
toward permanent arrangement of the collection.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="535" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 10.&mdash;Pillbox for temporary storage of insects. Enough cotton packing is
placed in the box to keep the specimen from rattling about but not so much that
it crushes the specimen.</p>
</div>
<p>The relaxer will sweat if kept in too hot a room and will spoil
the specimens. Also, the insects will be spoiled if left in the relaxer

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">HOW TO MOUNT AND PRESERVE SPECIMENS</span></h2>
<p>Most adult insects in collections are mounted on pins. Most
medium-sized to large insects, such as grasshoppers, butterflies, moths,
flies, bees, and many beetles should be pinned directly through the
body from top to bottom. Many small insects, such as leafhoppers,
plant bugs, small beetles, and the like, should be glued on card points.
Immature insects and the adults of some groups are best preserved
in fluid.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Preservation by Pinning</h3>
<p>Hard-bodied insects, such as beetles, flies, and wasps, are preserved
as dry specimens on pins better than in fluid. The pinned
specimens are more convenient to study and they retain their natural
coloring better. Flies and butterflies are covered with hairs or scales
that clot or break off if the specimens are preserved in fluid, and for
this reason they should be pinned.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Common household pins are too thick and short for pinning insects.
Longer, slender pins called insect pins are necessary and may
be purchased from various supply houses. They should be of spring
steel; a brass pin will corrode and be destroyed by acids in the insect&rsquo;s
body. The pins are available in numbered sizes, of which 1, 2, 3, and 4
will be found of most general use, and sizes 0 and 00 of advantage in
special cases.</p>
<p><b>Medium to Large Insects.</b>&mdash;Medium to large hard-shelled insects
such as moths, beetles, flies, bees, and wasps, should be pinned vertically
through the body, <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a><i>a</i>. It is essential that the pin pass
through a fairly solid part of the body, and, to insure this, the following
standard procedures should be adopted:</p>
<p>1. Bees, wasps, flies.&mdash;Pin through thorax between bases of front
wings slightly to right of middle line, <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a><i>b</i>.</p>
<p>2. Stink bugs.&mdash;Pin just to right of middle line of the scutellum
or large triangle between the bases of the front wings, <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a><i>c</i>.</p>
<p>3. Grasshoppers.&mdash;Pin through back part of prothorax (the
saddle behind the head) just to right of middle line, <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a><i>d</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 12.&mdash;Pinning. Moths, <i>a</i>, and butterflies, <i>b</i>, are pinned through the center
of the thorax (instead of to the right of the median line) between the bases of the

<p class="pcap">Fig. 13.&mdash;Pinning block. The block is
1&frac14; &times; 1&frac14; &times; 2&frac14; inches, with holes drilled
to the depths shown and having diameters
only slightly greater than the largest
pin that will be used. A specimen is
pinned and the pin inserted into one of
the holes until the pin touches bottom;
thus, insects may be pinned uniformly at
a desired height.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>4. Beetles.&mdash;Pin near front margin of right wing cover near
middle line, <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a><i>e</i>.</p>
<p>5. Moths, butterflies, dragonflies, damselflies.&mdash;Pin through the
center of the thorax between the bases of the front wings, <a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>.</p>
<p>The insect should be pushed about three-quarters of the distance
up the pin, but not so close to the top that no room is left for easy
handling of the pin with the fingers. It is well to have all insects
the same distance from the top of the pin. To insure a uniform distance,
the collector should use a pinning block. This is a small piece
of wood or metal usually in the form shown in <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>, into the top
of which are drilled holes slightly larger than the pin diameters. Such
a block may be fashioned of wood with holes made by small nails and
covered with a cardboard rectangle through which have been stabbed
holes the exact size of those in the wood. The depths of the holes in
the block should be three-eighths inch, three-quarters inch, and 1&#8539;
inches, respectively. To use the block, pin the insect and insert the
pin into whichever hole allows the specimen to be pushed up the pin
and still leave room, allowing for the thickness of the insect&rsquo;s body,
for handling at the top.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 14.&mdash;Pinning small insects and labeling. The insect may be glued to a
card point, <i>a</i>, which has been crimped to meet the right side of the body, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>;
or it may be pinned with a minuten pin, <i>d</i>, to a piece of cork or pith, which in turn
is regularly pinned. All pinned insects should be labeled, as at <i>e</i>. In the case of
some small insects, such as tiny moths, the minuten pin may be run down through
the body and then into the cork; in the case of others, such as mosquitoes, it is
often desirable to run the minuten pin up through the cork first and then impale
the specimen on the point of the pin.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p><b>Tiny Insects.</b>&mdash;Very small insects should be mounted on card
points or on minuten pins. Regular pins would break too many of the
insects&rsquo; body parts.</p>
<p>Card points are small triangles of cardboard or plastic pinned
through one of the sides and crimped over at the opposite apex; a spot
of strong glue is put on the angled tip, and the right side of the insect
is pressed against the glued surface, <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>. The slant of the crimp
depends on the angle of the insect&rsquo;s side; the desired product is the
insect mounted with its top surface horizontal and its head forward;
legs, wings, and antennae should be in view and as little of the body
as possible hidden by the glue or card point. Very little glue should
be used; a small amount holds well and gives a better specimen for
study than a large amount. The points may be cut uniformly with a
hand punch, and they should be about three-eighths inch long. Good
material for making these points is 2-ply Bristol board.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 15.&mdash;Pinning crane flies. Because of their unwieldy legs, these insects
should have a double card point mount, and the legs should be kept away from the
pin so that they will not be broken in handling.</p>
</div>
<p>Minuten pins are short, extremely delicate steel pins, <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a><i>d</i>.
One of these is thrust through the body of the insect and into a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
piece of cork, pith, or similar substance, which is in turn pinned in
the regular way a card point is. This method is especially desirable
for tiny moths.</p>
<p><b>Insects Hard to Pin.</b>&mdash;Wasps, lacewings, damselflies, and similar
insects have an abdomen that sags readily when the specimen is killed
and pinned. This unwanted drooping can be prevented in three simple
ways. (1) Stick the pinned insect on a vertical surface of a block so
that the body by its own weight dries in normal position. (2) Pin
the insect on a horizontal surface and run a stiff paper on the pin
beneath the body in such a way as to support it in a natural position
until the insect dries. (3) Brace the abdomen by crossing two pins
beneath it and thrusting them into the block, allowing the specimen to
dry in the angle of the cross.</p>
<p>Crane flies are unwieldy and so are best pinned on a double card
point mount, <a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>. The legs should be directed away from the pin
to avoid breakage in handling.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Spreading Board for Moths and Butterflies</h3>
<p>Moths and butterflies should have their wings spread before being
put into the collection. To do this well, it is necessary to have spreading
boards that are accurately made but that are not necessarily
complicated or expensive.</p>
<p><b>Construction.</b>&mdash;A convenient board for medium-sized insects can
be made at home of the following materials:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1.&mdash;A hardwood base, 4 &times; 12 &times; &frac14; inch.</dt>
<dt>2.&mdash;Two hardwood end pieces, 4 &times; &frac34; &times; &frac12; inch.</dt>
<dt>3.&mdash;Two softwood top pieces, 1&#8542; &times; 12 &times; &frac12; inch, with the top surface planed at an angle, so that the thickness at one edge is &frac12; inch and at the other &#8540; inch.</dt>
<dt>4.&mdash;Two flat cork pieces 1 &times; 11 &times; &sup3;/&#8321;&#8326; inch.</dt></dl>
<p>Nail the top pieces to the ends so that the slanting surfaces of
the tops are uppermost and the narrower edges parallel and one-quarter
inch apart, <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>. Glue one strip of cork beneath the top
pieces, covering the opening between and fitting snugly at each end.
Glue the other cork piece flat to the upper side of the base, lengthwise
along the middle, and extending to within one-half inch of each end.
Finally, nail the base across the bottoms of the end pieces, so that the
two corks face each other.</p>
<p><b>Use.</b>&mdash;Before spreading the specimen, relax it as described under
<a href="#c11">&ldquo;Relaxing Boxes and Jars.&rdquo;</a> Then pin it, keeping in mind <a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a> and
the directions given under <a href="#c13">&ldquo;Preservation by Pinning.&rdquo;</a> Thrust the
pin, with the insect on it, through the upper cork of the board and
into the cork on the base. Insert the insect body in the groove so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the wing bases are level with the near edge of each top piece. Hold
the wings at the top level by two narrow strips of paper and pull them
forward until the hind margin of the front wing is at right angles
to the body axis, and the front margin of the hind wing is just under
the front wing, <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>. Pin the wings temporarily in this position
by inserting a pin, size 0 or 00, near the front margin at the base
of each wing. When the wings on both sides of the insect are thus
adjusted, lay strong pieces of paper over them and pin them down
securely with large pins inserted close to the wings but not through
them. Here you may use large common pins, but still better are the
large-headed dressmaker&rsquo;s pins about 1&frac14; inches long. Finally, remove
the original adjusting pins and put the specimen in a dry, pest-proof
container for 2 or 3 weeks. It will then have set sufficiently to
be removed from the board.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 16.&mdash;Spreading board for moths and butterflies. The insect is pinned
with its body in the groove and, temporarily, with all its wings drawn forward and
pinned as shown for the right wings. Then all wings are pinned as shown for the
left wings, and the insect is allowed to dry. The inset shows a view of spreading
board construction. The top pieces of the board must be smooth and of soft wood.
First grade pine is satisfactory.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>For good results, spreading boards with grooves of various
widths are necessary; a specimen should be spread on a board with
a groove that fits the body. The width of the top pieces should vary
to accommodate different wingspreads. The slope of the top pieces
should be about as described.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Preservation in Fluid</h3>
<p>Caterpillars and other immature stages of insects should be preserved
in 80 per cent grain alcohol. Caterpillars, grubs, and maggots
should first be heated 5 to 10 minutes in water just at the boiling
point. This treatment sterilizes the specimens and prevents their
discoloration by bacteria in the digestive system.</p>
<p>Many soft-bodied adult insects, including bristletails, springtails,
stoneflies, and caddisflies, also should be preserved in fluid. If pinned,
they shrivel to such an extent that few identifying characters can be
seen. The preserving fluid in the vials in which insects have been
placed should be changed at the end of the first day or two.</p>
<p>Some hard-shelled insects may be preserved in fluid. Ants and
beetles may be thus treated temporarily and later pinned and dried.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">HOW TO LABEL THE SPECIMENS</span></h2>
<p>To be useful to the entomologist and others interested in the
scientific relations of insects, as well as to furnish the collector with
a complete record of his hours in the field and make more valuable
the work he has already accomplished, the specimens should be
labeled. The important information to be put on the label of each
specimen is the locality and date of capture, but greater scientific
value will be attached to the specimen by adding the name of the
collector and the host on which the insect was found, or the particular
habitat in which the insect was caught.</p>
<p>Labels should be made of a good grade of white paper stiff
enough to stay flat when pierced and pushed up the pins. A very satisfactory
high quality paper is available under the name &ldquo;substance
36 ledger.&rdquo; The labels may be printed by hand with a crow-quill pen
and black India ink, or they may be purchased completely or partially
printed from a biological supply house. They should be as small as
possible and of nearly uniform size. They should be pushed up the
pins, <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>, not too near the specimens, and they should project from
the pins in the same direction as the specimens. To keep the labels
small, yet to include all desirable information, it is often well to
record the locality, collection date, and collector on one label, and the
host plant or other pertinent information on a second label, <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>When the specimen is identified, its name should be recorded on
still another label, which should be kept low on the pin. Sample identification
labels are illustrated by the bottom labels in <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">HOUSING THE COLLECTION PERMANENTLY</span></h2>
<p>After the specimens have been pinned and labeled, they should
be housed in boxes or cases having a soft bottom or inner layer that
will allow easy pinning. Such housing not only insures the safety of
the collection but makes for easily handled units once the specimens
have been named.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Insect Boxes</h3>
<p>Several satisfactory types of boxes for housing insect specimens
may be bought from commercial supply companies. These are usually
much better than boxes of home construction, being more nearly
dustproof and pestproof. Homemade boxes, however, are quite practical
for the beginning collector, due to their ease of construction and
extremely low cost. Cigar boxes 2 inches deep or more make ideal
insect boxes if a layer of cork or balsa wood or two layers of soft,
corrugated cardboard are glued in the bottom. Other wooden or cardboard
boxes may be provided with such a bottom pinning surface
and used for storing specimens. Boxes of this type, however, afford
the specimens no protection against pests, and great care must be
exercised in keeping the boxes fumigated.</p>
<p>Manufactured boxes, cabinets, and cases may be selected from
catalogs that various scientific supply firms send free upon application.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Precaution Against Pests</h3>
<p>Certain insects, such as flour beetles and carpet beetles, feed upon
dried insects, and unless precautions are taken these may entirely
destroy a collection. To guard against them, various chemical repellents
may be placed in the boxes containing specimens. Naphthalene,
of which ordinary mothballs are composed, is one of the best repellents.
A few mothballs may be put in a cloth bag pinned securely in
one corner of the box, or the heads of common pins may be inserted
into naphthalene mothballs, and the points stuck in the corners of
the box, <a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>.</p>
<p>Naphthalene is chiefly repellent in action; its odor keeps out
pests, but, if they are already in the specimen boxes, naphthalene will
usually not kill these pests, and some other substance must be used.</p>
<p>Paradichlorobenzene, called PDB, is a good fumigant to use on
pests in the collection. It should be used in a nearly airtight container,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
such as a tight trunk, bin, or case, at the rate of 1 pound of PDB to
25 cubic feet of space. The boxes of specimens, with lids open or removed,
should be placed in the container, the fumigant scattered or
spread on a piece of cloth or paper above them, and the container
sealed for about a week.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 17.&mdash;A naphthalene mothball mounted on a common pin.
It serves as a repellent to keep away from the collection live insects
that might cause damage. To insert the pin, stick the point in a
cork, heat the head in a flame, and then push the head into a mothball.
The pin will melt its way into the naphthalene, which will
cool and harden again almost immediately.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">THE INSECT WORLD</span></h2>
<p>When the insects have been collected, mounted or preserved, and
labeled, the next step is to identify or name them. This is no easy
task, because there are so many different kinds of insects. In the
whole world there are well over 1 million different kinds and in Illinois
alone probably 20,000 different kinds.</p>
<p>The identification of insects is simplified somewhat by the fact
that many species are closely related and can be classified into a
number of major groups. Insects as a whole constitute what is called
a <i>class</i> of animals, the Insecta. The crabs, shrimps, and their allies
constitute a class called the Crustacea; the snakes, turtles, lizards, and
their allies constitute another class called the Reptilia; and so on. The
entire insect class is divided into <i>orders</i>, such as the Coleoptera, or
beetles, the Diptera, or flies, and the Siphonaptera, or fleas. Each of
these orders may contain several dozen to 25,000 different kinds of
insects in North America alone. These orders are divided into <i>families</i>,
each of which may contain one species to many thousands of
species. The family names always end in <i>-idae</i>, as in Pentatomidae,
the name for the stink bugs. The families are divided into <i>genera</i>
(the plural for genus), and the various <i>species</i> (the word is the same
for both singular and plural) or kinds are placed in the genera.</p>
<p>The house fly bears the name <i>Musca domestica</i> Linnaeus; this
means that the species name is <i>domestica</i>, that the name was first
applied to the species by Carolus Linnaeus (known as the describer
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
of the insect or the author of the name), and that the species <i>domestica</i>
is in the genus <i>Musca</i>. The genus <i>Musca</i> belongs to the family
Muscidae, which, in turn, belongs to the order Diptera of the class
Insecta.</p>
<p>Scientists may decide that a certain species belongs in another
genus. When the species is transferred from the genus in which it
was originally described to another genus, the name of the author is
placed in parentheses. For example, the chinch bug was originally
described by Thomas Say in the genus <i>Lygaeus</i> and had the name
<i>Lygaeus leucopterus</i> Say. Later the species <i>leucopterus</i> was transferred
to the genus <i>Blissus</i>, and Say&rsquo;s name was placed in parentheses,
thus: <i>Blissus leucopterus</i> (Say).</p>
<p>In the process of growth, insects go through a series of interesting
stages. When the immature insect reaches a certain size, its
outside skin covering or cuticle will not stretch further and the insect
then acquires a larger cuticle by a process called <i>molting</i>.</p>
<p>Molting consists of a definite sequence of steps: (1) A goodly
portion of the inside layer of the cuticle is dissolved by special glands
situated among cells immediately below the cuticle; (2) the cells
under the cuticle then exude material which forms a new cuticle beneath
what is left of the old cuticle; (3) when the new cuticle is
completely formed, the insect breaks a slit in the old cuticle, crawls
out of it, and leaves it behind in the form of a cast skin; (4) the
insect goes through many contortions, during which the soft parts of
the new cuticle are stretched to a larger size than the corresponding
parts of the old one; (5) the cuticle becomes set and unstretchable
almost immediately, and the insect resumes its normal activities.
During the molting process, the hard plates of each new cuticle are
formed a size larger than the corresponding parts of the old cuticle,
and the soft parts are stretched a size larger than the old. When the
insect resumes its normal activities immediately after a molt, the soft
parts of the cuticle fall into a large number of pleats or folds between
the hard parts. As the insect grows larger following a molt, the body
can lengthen by the unfolding of these pleated areas.</p>
<p>The stages of the insect between molts are called <i>instars</i>. Among
the different orders of insects the number of instars in the life history
may vary, and various instars may have different forms. These characteristics
of molting and instars are therefore important items in
the classification of insects.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The insect orders are arranged in a classification based on the
sequence in which the orders are believed to have evolved, <a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>.
Measured by geological time, insects are among the oldest of land
animals, having first evolved from an earlier, centipede-like ancestor
about 400 million years ago. The first insects had no wings and differed
from the many-legged centipede-like creatures of that time
chiefly in having only three pairs of functional legs. The legs were
situated on the three segments immediately behind the head; the
three distinctive segments are together called the <i>thorax</i>. The part
of the body behind the thorax is called the <i>abdomen</i>. In contrast to
this arrangement, a centipede has a pair of legs on each of its many
segments for the whole length of the body. The slow evolutionary
change from such a many-legged ancestral form to a typical insect
undoubtedly occurred by a gradual enlargement and strengthening
of the front three pairs of legs and a reduction of the legs posterior
to these. Evidence supporting this idea is found in insect embryos,
which normally have rudimentary leg structures on the abdominal
segments, and in some of the extremely primitive insects, which have
rudimentary legs called styli on some segments of the abdomen. The
result of this evolutionary development is a body having the front
part, the thorax, specialized for locomotion and the back part, the
abdomen, serving chiefly as a container for the vital organs, such as
those of the digestive and reproductive systems.</p>

<p>Five existing orders of insects, all found in Illinois, are representative
of the primeval wingless insects. In all five, the individual
molts at intervals, even after becoming adult and sexually mature,
and the old and young are extremely similar. Three of the primitive
orders, the campodeids, proturans, and springtails, belong to a specialized
early branch of the insect family tree, <a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>, in which the
cheeks have grown forward to form a pouch surrounding the mouthparts.
In the other two primitive orders, the bristletails and silverfish,
the mouthparts are in a normally exposed condition, but the legs
are larger and the insects are rapid runners.</p>
<p>From one of these ancestral, silverfish-like insects arose a form
in which wings evolved. In birds and bats, the wings are converted
front legs with membranes or feathers attached to form planing or
flying surfaces. In insects, on the other hand, the wings are outgrowths
of the edge of the body where the sides and top come together, <a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>.
The wings probably began as side flanges of the thorax and permitted
a certain amount of planing. Whatever their origin, two pairs of flying
wings did evolve, one pair on the second and another on the third
segment of the thorax.</p>
<p>In the early winged forms, the wings could not be folded back in
repose over the body, but were held out from the sides like airplane
wings or together above the body like sails. Two living orders of insects
represent this type, the mayflies and the dragonflies. In both
of these, as in other winged insects, the wings form as small pads
during the early stages of the individual; then at a final molt they
are unfolded as functional units. In the mayflies, one more molt occurs
after the wings are formed; in this molt the old outside covering of
the wings is shed along with that of the rest of the insect. In all other
winged insects no molt occurs after the wings are formed and the
individual becomes sexually mature.</p>
<p>Insects having erect, nonfolding wings were abundant some 300
million years ago. Fossil remains of many of these early forms have
been found in the Mazon Creek area in Illinois, <a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>.</p>
<p>From one of these early winged types a form evolved in which
the wings could be folded compactly over the body; this form gave
rise to a great many of our present-day insects. In the first insects
that evolved from this form the wing pads of the immature stages,
called nymphs, grew as external and often inconspicuous flaps held
close to the body. These primitive insects comprise three distinctive
groups, characterized mainly by differences in leg and body structure.
One group contains the cockroaches, grasshoppers, and their allies;
the second includes only the stoneflies; and the third group includes
the barklice, true lice, bugs, and their allies.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the primitive lines of wing-folding insects, possibly an
offshoot from the base of the barklouse-bug line, evolved into a distinctly
different type in which the wing pads of the immature stages
developed internally and appeared as external pads only in the stage
before the adult form. The type was characterized by a marked difference
of appearance between the various stages of the life history;
these stages have been given distinctive names. The first immature
stage, which is without external wing pads, is called a <i>larva</i>; the
single stage with the external wing pads is called the <i>pupa</i>; and the
final winged, sexually mature stage is called the <i>adult</i>. The larva is
essentially a growing stage, the pupa is a quiescent stage of internal
reorganization, and the adult is the <i>egg</i>-producing stage. This type of
insect gradually gave rise to the orders which now contain the largest
number of species, including the beetles, moths, and flies. In many
lines of this neuropteroid branch, as it is called, the larva has become
adapted to a mode of life quite different from that of the adult. Many
fly larvae, for example, live in rotting organic material or live as parasites
within the tissues of other kinds of insects, whereas the adult
flies often feed at flowers on pollen and nectar, visiting the site of the
larval habitat only to lay eggs. As a result of this type of evolution,
members of the neuropteroid orders exhibit many bizarre and complicated
life histories.</p>
<p>Occasionally certain groups of winged insects evolved new types
which had small wings or were wingless. The new types resulted because
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
the groups were subjected to environmental situations where
wings were of little survival value. Within the groups, individuals
with smaller wings were favored; they survived and reproduced in
greater numbers than other individuals. Over many generations then,
the wings in some groups became very small or were entirely lost.
Sometimes this loss of wings occurred in all the adult forms, as in
the fleas. Individuals of only one sex may be wingless, as are the females
of two Illinois moths, one of which produces bagworms and the
other cankerworms. In two groups, the termites and the ants, a wingless
worker or soldier caste is produced; in these groups the normal
adults which swarm and reproduce are fully winged. These winged
forms establish new colonies.</p>
<p>Wings were lost in the evolutionary development of two insect
groups that became parasites of warm-blooded animals, both birds
and mammals. Each of these insect groups developed into a large,
distinctive order. One order, the true lice, evolved from the barklice,
and the other, the fleas, evolved possibly from a primeval fly group.
Although these two orders, the lice and the fleas, are without wings,
the structure of their bodies and their life histories provide adequate
testimony of their evolutionary affinities.</p>
<p>The following synopsis of Illinois insects treats the various kinds
in the sequence in which we believe they evolved, from the extremely
primitive bristletails to the highly specialized flies.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">HOW TO IDENTIFY SPECIMENS</span></h2>
<p>As an aid to the beginner in making preliminary identification
of his specimens and also as an aid in arranging his collection, a short
descriptive synopsis of the orders of living insects is given below. In
this description are noted the most distinctive features of the common
insects occurring in Illinois. There are rare and obscure forms, seldom
met by the collector, that require a more technical key for their identification;
for these the collector will need to consult some of the more
nearly complete books listed on <a href="#Page_70">page 70</a>. The collector will find, however,
that this synopsis will afford a beginning for his classification
of the common forms.</p>
<p>Various characters are used to identify an insect to family, genus,
and species. Among these characters are the antennae, wings (if
present), legs, and mouthparts. Frequently important for identification
are such minute details as hair or scales covering the body or
wings and the texture of these parts. In most cases good microscopic
equipment is necessary to see clearly the characters used in the diagnosis
of insects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">SYNOPSIS OF ILLINOIS INSECT ORDERS</span></h2>
<p>Of the 28 orders of insects recognized in North America, 26 have
been collected in Illinois. The two orders not found here are the Embioptera
or webspinners, a tropical and subtropical order, and the
Raphidiodea or snakeflies, which occur in the western mountainous
region of the continent.</p>
<p>The Illinois fauna thus contains a remarkable variety of insects,
including forms such as the bristletails, mayflies, and cockroaches,
which are practically &ldquo;living fossils&rdquo; of insects that lived hundreds
of millions of years ago.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Primitive Wingless Insects</h3>
<p>Only five orders of primitive wingless insects are known; species
of each order occur in Illinois. These orders represent the stages in
insect evolution before wings had appeared.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h4 id="c24">Diplura
<br /><span class="hst">Campodeids, Japygids</span></h4>
<p>Small, wingless, fragile, blind, whitish insects that
run fairly rapidly. They have long antennae and
either two fairly long tails or a pair of forceps-like
structures at the end of the abdomen. They
are terrestrial and are found chiefly under stones in humid and shady
situations. <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a> shows a common campodeid, a species of <i>Campodea</i>,
occurring commonly in Illinois.</p>
<p>The Diplura feed on fungi and other soil microorganisms.
Although they are found most frequently under stones, they live also
in the soil and in matted leaves or duff on the floor of woods. About a
dozen species of Diplura occur in Illinois.</p>
<h4 id="c25">Protura
<br /><span class="hst">Proturans</span></h4>
<p>Minute, wingless, blind insects that never grow to
more than 0.05 inch long. They have no antennae
and use the front legs to some extent for feeling.
They are terrestrial and are found inhabiting dead twigs and leaves
on the forest floor. <a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a> shows <i>Acerentulus barberi</i> Ewing, a member
of a genus which occurs in many localities in Illinois. Only a few species
of proturans have been taken in the state.</p>
<h4 id="c26">Collembola
<br /><span class="hst">Springtails</span></h4>
<p>Small, wingless insects that jump and crawl when
disturbed. They have short antennae and usually
a springing structure on the under side near the
posterior end of the body. They live in moist places and are abundant
under leaf mold and similar material. Illustrated in <a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a> is <i>Achorutes
armatus</i> Nicolet, which often becomes a major pest in mushroom cellars
and greenhouses.</p>
<p>About a hundred different species of Collembola occur in Illinois;
they include some of our smallest insects. A few never grow longer
than 0.007 inch; the largest approach half an inch in length. These
hardy animals are active all year and are surprisingly resistant to
cold. Certain species occur on snow in winter. In Illinois a small,
bluish gray species, <i>Podura aquatica</i> Linnaeus, is found on the surface
of still water at the margins of ponds and small streams.</p>
<h4 id="c27">Microcoryphia
<br /><span class="hst">Bristletails</span></h4>
<p>Wingless, somewhat cylindrical insects that run
and jump with extreme rapidity. They have long
antennae and three long tails. The under side of
the abdomen bears several pairs of short projections called styli, which
are vestiges of abdominal legs. Bristletails live in rocky places or in
ground cover. A type occurring in some parts of Illinois is shown in
<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>. It often occurs on rocky exposures, where it resembles the
lichens and is difficult to detect.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h4 id="c28">Thysanura
<br /><span class="hst">Silverfish</span></h4>
<p>Wingless, flat insects that run rapidly. They have
long antennae and three long tails. They are terrestrial
and are commonly found in dwellings.
<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a> shows one of the common Silverfish, <i>Thermobia domestica</i>
(Packard); it frequently eats book bindings and other starchy materials.
Some out-of-door rare forms live in the soil and are seldom
collected.</p>
<h3 id="c29">Primitive Winged Insects</h3>
<p>The primitive winged insects cannot fold their wings, which in
repose are held erect over the body or straight out from the sides,
as illustrated in figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a> and <a href="#fig29">29</a>. Although many types of these insects
lived in bygone ages, only two orders have survived to the
present. Both occur abundantly in Illinois.</p>
<h4 id="c30">Ephemeroptera
<br /><span class="hst">Mayflies</span></h4>
<p>A group of insects in which the nymphs or young
live in streams and lakes; the adults are found
along the edges of the streams or lakes from
which they have emerged. Mayflies are unique in that the full-grown
nymphs molt into winged insects that are not quite mature and that
molt again, usually the next day, when they emerge as fully mature
adults. The nymphs are varied in shape and have short antennae, long
legs, which are often flattened, and three tails at the end of the body.
The adult flies have very long front legs, short antennae, practically
no mouthparts, usually two pairs of wings, and two or three long
tails. When a mayfly is at rest, the wings are held together above
the body. <i>Hexagenia limbata</i> (Serville), figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a> and <a href="#fig27">27</a>, is one of the
very common Illinois mayflies and is an important factor in the food
economy of many fish.</p>
<p>Mayflies, formerly called Plectoptera, together with stoneflies,
caddisflies, and midges, constitute a very large portion of the life of
our lakes and streams; all four groups are important as fish food.</p>
<h4 id="c31">Odonata
<br /><span class="hst">Dragonflies, Damselflies</span></h4>
<p>Another order in which the nymphs develop in
streams, lakes, or ponds, and in which the adults
are aerial. The nymphs have short antennae, long
legs, and either a stout body with no tail, as in
<i>Anax junius</i> (Drury), <a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a> (dragonfly nymph), or a slender body
with three large leaflike gills projecting from the end of the body
(damselfly nymph). A most distinctive feature of this order is an
extensile, highly modified lower lip that fits like a mask over the face
of a nymph. The lower lip is hinged to extend forward and seize the
small animals upon which the nymph lives. The adults are large, often
beautifully colored, as is the <i>Tramea lacerata</i> Hagen, <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>. They
have chewing mouthparts and two pairs of large wings, very finely
and intricately netted with veins.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 26.&mdash;Ephemeroptera.
<i>Hexagenia limbata</i>, the adult
form; this mayfly is also
called shadfly or willowfly.
Mayflies sometimes emerge
in great swarms and congregate
in piles around bridge
or city lights. Actual length
about 1.0 inch.</p>

in <a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>; in this stage the

when full grown. Actual
length about 1.0 inch.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The order is divided into two types; the adult flies are told apart
as follows:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">Body stout, wings broad at base, the front and hind wings different in shape. Strong fliers. Dragonflies </td><td class="l">Suborder <b>Anisoptera</b></td></tr>

</div>
<h3 id="c32">Folding-Wing Insects</h3>
<p>Almost all insects in this category can fold their wings in repose
back over their bodies, as illustrated in <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>. A few kinds, notably
some of the moths and butterflies, have lost this wing action and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
repose hold their wings erect. In some of these kinds, the male is
winged and the female is wingless; in others, certain generations
may be wingless and others winged; and, in still others, the species
may be wingless in all stages. No members of the orders of folding-wing
insects molt after becoming winged or sexually mature.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h4 id="c33">Cursoria
<br /><span class="hst">Cockroaches, Mantids, Walkingsticks</span></h4>
<p>An order that includes three groups of terrestrial
insects, each group markedly different in appearance
from the others: (1) rapidly running insects
usually having two pairs of wings, each with
a dense network of fine veins, the front pair of
wings thick and leathery, <a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a> (cockroaches); (2) winged insects
having long, grasping front legs, <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a> (praying mantids); and long,
wingless insects resembling sticks, <a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a> (walkingsticks). The
mouthparts are fitted for chewing. The young look and act like the
adults except that they do not have wings. The cockroaches are omnivorous,
feeding chiefly on organic foods rich in carbohydrates, or on
fungus growth. Cockroaches are among our most persistent indoor
pests, eating a wide variety of domestic foods. The praying mantids
feed on other insects, which they capture in their enlarged front legs.
The walkingsticks eat leaves. The cockroaches and mantids lay eggs
that are glued together and form pods or capsules, each containing
30 or more eggs. The walkingsticks lay their eggs singly.</p>

<h4 id="c34">Isoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Termites</span></h4>
<p>Fragile or soft insects with chewing mouthparts.
The mating forms are dark brown and have two
similar pairs of wings; both pairs are delicate and
have a fine network of veins. The workers are white and soft bodied.
Termites, which live in colonies in wood, are also called &ldquo;white ants,&rdquo;
although they are not true ants. The common native species in Illinois
is <i>Reticulitermes flavipes</i> (Kollar), <a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>, which lives in rotten logs
and is destructive to buildings of wooden construction throughout
Illinois; it is most destructive in the southern part of the state.</p>

<h4 id="c35">Orthoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Grasshoppers, Crickets</span></h4>
<p>Terrestrial insects usually with two pairs of
wings, each wing with a very fine, dense network
of veins, the front pair thick and leathery, the
hind pair delicate and fanlike. The mouthparts,
fitted for chewing, have stout mandibles. The young look and act like
the adults but do not have wings. This order includes all the grasshoppers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
crickets, and katydids. <a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> shows the migratory locust or
grasshopper, <i>Melanoplus bilituratus</i> (Walker). Adults of several of
the groups of Orthoptera never develop wings. These include such odd
forms as the cave crickets, exemplified by <i>Ceuthophilus maculatus</i>
(Harris), <a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>.</p>
<h4 id="c36">Dermaptera
<br /><span class="hst">Earwigs</span></h4>
<p>Insects with two pairs of wings, the front pair
forming short, hard covers, the second pair large,
membranous, many-veined, and in repose folded
intricately beneath the front pair. The abdomen ends in a pair of
pincer-like structures. A common Illinois form is <i>Labia minor</i> (Linnaeus),
shown in <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>. Of the half-dozen species known from Illinois,
all but one were originally from Europe or Asia. Earwig females
lay eggs in chambers in the ground and guard them.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h4 id="c37">Plecoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Stoneflies</span></h4>
<p>Insects that pass the young or nymphal stage in
streams. They have slender, soft bodies and long
tails; they move about rapidly. The adults are
terrestrial in habit and occur along streams. In most species, the
adults have two pairs of wings that are folded flat over the back; the
number of crossveins varies from many to few. The antennae are
long; the mouthparts are of the chewing type but greatly reduced. Of
exceptional interest are stonefly adults that emerge in winter and are
active from November through March. The winter forms can often
be collected on bridges. Figs. <a href="#fig37">37</a> and <a href="#fig38">38</a> illustrate a spring species,
<i>Isoperla confusa</i> Frison.</p>
<h4 id="c38">Zoraptera
<br /><span class="hst">Zorapterans</span></h4>
<p>Small, whitish insects, about a twelfth of an inch
long, that run rapidly. They live in small colonies
in rotting sawdust, in rotten logs, and under the
bark of stumps. They have fairly long antennae, chewing mouthparts,
and a pair of short, inconspicuous tails. Most members of a colony
are wingless, but occasionally there occurs a darker specimen having
two pairs of wings. These wings have only a few veins. In Illinois
only a single rare species has been found; it is called <i>Zorotypus hubbardi</i>
Caudell, <a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>.</p>
<h4 id="c39">Corrodentia
<br /><span class="hst">Booklice, Barklice</span></h4>
<p>Small, rounded or flattened insects, rarely a quarter-inch
long, usually about 0.13 inch. In many
species, adults have two pairs of wings, which
have only a few zigzagging veins. Winged forms,
such as <i>Psocus striatus</i> Walker, <a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>, are found in crevices of bark
and on dead leaves. Common species found in houses and on stored
grain are usually wingless and louselike, similar in general appearance
to <a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>. Corrodentia eat fungus growth on bark, dead leaves, moldy
grain, damp books, and similar materials. Some of the outdoor species
become very abundant on drying corn leaves during autumn and may
breed in immense numbers. They do little harm, feeding chiefly on
fungus strands.</p>
<h4 id="c40">Phthiraptera
<br /><span class="hst">Chewing Lice, Sucking Lice</span></h4>
<p>Wingless, blind, flattened insects with short antennae,
short legs, inconspicuous mouthparts, and
no tails on the posterior end of body. They are
found exclusively on the bodies of birds and other
warm-blooded animals. The young have the same general shape and
habits as the adults and are found with them. Illinois species of lice
belong to two distinct suborders, which may be differentiated through
use of the following key:</p>

<p>Individuals of many species of chewing
lice move about with considerable rapidity. Many of them are very
prettily banded and colored, as is the chicken head louse, <i>Cuclotogaster
heterographus</i> (Nitzsch), <a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>. Anyone who has worked with domestic
fowls or animals has seen members of this order scurrying
among the feathers or hair. These insects feed on what they can chew
from the surface of the skin and in some cases are known to injure
their hosts.</p>
<h4 id="c42"><i>Suborder Anoplura.</i></h4>
<p>The sucking lice are sluggish insects that
usually cling to hairs. Human lice are often found clinging to clothing.
Various species occur on native and domestic species of mammals
in Illinois. <a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a> shows the horse louse, <i>Haematopinus asini</i> (Linnaeus).</p>

<p>Small, active insects, usually about 0.1 inch long,
rarely a quarter-inch long, very slender, usually
each with two pairs of narrow wings and with
the under side of the head forming a sharp, conelike sucking structure.
Each wing has a long fringe on the hind margin; each front wing
may have one or two veins running the length of the wing. The young
of these insects are somewhat similar to the adults but are softer
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
bodied. <a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a> shows an adult of <i>Thrips tabaci</i> Lindeman, the onion
thrips. Thrips suck the juice from plants. Because of their minute
size, they are seldom noticed, but they can be collected in large numbers
from blossoms of almost any plant. A few species of thrips,
such as the onion thrips and the privet thrips, attack agricultural or
horticultural plants and inflict considerable damage. A few species
occasionally bite human beings.</p>
<h4 id="c44">Hemiptera
<br /><span class="hst">True Bugs and Their Allies</span></h4>
<p>Insects usually with two pairs of wings and with
the mouthparts formed for sucking. The order
contains two distinct suborders, the Heteroptera
and the Homoptera. All species of Hemiptera in
North America fall readily into one suborder or the other, but certain
species in other parts of the world are intermediate between the two
suborders.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 44.&mdash;Hemiptera. A typical stink bug of the family Pentatomidae, showing
attachment of beak and arrangement of wings. Actual length about 0.4 inch.</p>
</div>
<p>In the suborder Heteroptera, containing the stink bugs, the chinch
bugs, and their allies, the beak is attached to the under side of the
front part of the head; the base of the front pair of wings is hardened,
and only the apical portion is membranous or delicate; the entire
hind pair is delicate. In repose, the wings are folded over and flat
against the body, the hind pair underneath. These characters are
shown in <a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a>, which pictures a stink bug belonging to the family
Pentatomidae. The young have the same general appearance and
habits as the adults, but they lack wings. This suborder includes many
common kinds, such as the water bugs, the water striders (these
seldom develop wings even in the adult stage), the ambush bugs, and
the lace bugs, as well as the stink bugs and the chinch bugs. The chief
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
pest of this group is the chinch bug, <i>Blissus leucopterus</i> (Say), <a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>.
Other pests include many kinds of plant bugs, of which <i>Lygus
lineolaris</i> (Beauvois) is shown in <a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>. The bed bugs, another group
never developing functional wings, also belong in this suborder.</p>

<p>The suborder Homoptera contains the cicadas, aphids, and their
allies. All these insects have sucking mouthparts, but in each the
beak is attached at the back of the head instead of the front of the
head as in the suborder Heteroptera. In many species of the Homoptera,
each individual has two pairs of wings, both of which are membranous.
Probably as many species are without wings, however, as
with them. The nymphs are in most respects similar to the adults.
Sexual characters, and in some forms wings, gradually develop as
the insects approach the adult stage, when development is complete.</p>

</div>
<p>This suborder contains a large number of economic pests, including
scale insects and leafhoppers, as well as many aphids. In many
species of aphids each insect has a pair of tubular structures near
the end of the body; these are called cornicles and can be seen in <a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
showing the corn root aphid, <i>Anuraphis maidiradicis</i> (Forbes). In
most species of scale insects each individual produces a tough scale,
which covers and protects its delicate body, as in <a href="#fig48">fig. 48</a>, showing the
destructive San Jose scale, <i>Aspidiotus perniciosus</i> Comstock. Leafhoppers
of many kinds, such as <i>Empoasca fabae</i> (Harris), <a href="#fig49">fig. 49</a>, are
among the destructive pests of beans, potatoes, grapes, apples, and
other plants. The treehoppers, spittlebugs, and lanternflies also belong
to this suborder.</p>
<h4 id="c45">Megaloptera
<br /><span class="hst">Alderflies, Dobsonflies</span></h4>
<p>In this and in the following orders of insects, the
life history includes four distinct stages, the egg,
the larva, the pupa, and the adult. In the Megaloptera,
which include alderflies and dobsonflies, the
larvae are caterpillar-like or grublike, and the pupae represent a
transformation stage in which the tissues of the larvae are converted
to those of the adults. The larvae never have external wing pads; in
winged species, these pads first appear externally in the pupae. The
adults have long antennae, two similar pairs of net-veined wings,
and chewing mouthparts. They are moderately strong fliers. The larvae,
<a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>, live in streams and lakes; when fully grown they migrate
to dry land and pupate in the ground or under the bark of rotten logs.</p>
<p>Typical of the appearance of Illinois alderflies is the adult of
<i>Sialis mohri</i> Ross, shown in <a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>. Well known to the fisherman is
the hellgrammite, the tough, ferocious, leathery larva found under
rocks in streams and prized for bait. This larva matures into the large
dobsonfly, <i>Corydalis cornuta</i> (Linnaeus), which often attains a wingspread
of 4 inches.</p>
<h4 id="c46">Neuroptera
<br /><span class="hst">Lacewings and Their Allies</span></h4>
<p>Insects with two pairs of wings, both pairs about
the same size and shape and intricately netted
with veins; antennae long and slender, mouthparts
fitted for chewing, posterior end of body
without tails. The green lacewings, including <i>Chrysopa nigricornis</i>
Burmeister, <a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>, are our commonest members of this order. The
young or larvae of this order are entirely unlike the adults and are
somewhat grublike in form. The aphid lion, the interesting larva of
<i>Chrysopa</i>, <a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>, is frequently collected by the sweeping method. Another
interesting larva of this order is the doodlebug or ant lion, of
Huckleberry Finn fame. The adult insects that mature from these ant
lion larvae are very similar in appearance to the chrysopids or lacewings.
The larva of each of these insects sinks its long, sharp, curved
mandibles into the body of its prey and sucks out the body juices.
The female <i>Chrysopa</i> has the curious habit of forming a long, slender
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
stalk under each egg; the bottom of the stalk is fastened to the upper
side of a leaf. The stalks are thought to have the effect of keeping the
first larvae of a hatch from devouring the eggs placed nearby.</p>
<p>When the larva is mature, it spins a globular, silken cocoon or
cell around itself and in this changes into the pupal, or quiescent,
stage. While the pupa itself does not appear active, within it the larval
tissues are reorganized into the structures of the adult, and the final
growth of the wings and reproductive organs occurs. When this
change is completed, the adult insect emerges from the cocoon.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c47">Coleoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Beetles, Weevils</span></h4>
<p>Insects with two pairs of wings, the second pair
delicate and folded under the first pair, which are
hard and thickened and folded back against the
body, touching each other along the midline to
form a hard shell, as shown in <i>Copris minutus</i> (Drury), <a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>. The
upper wings are not used for locomotion, but form part of the body
armor and are called <i>elytra</i>. In most beetles they cover the entire
posterior part of the body; in many others they are abbreviated and
cover only part of the abdomen. The immature stages of the beetles
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
are wormlike or grublike and have a great variety of food habits.
Some of them defoliate plants, others attack roots, and still others feed
on other insects.</p>
<p>A great many of the serious insect pests, including kinds that attack
field crops, stored products, and household goods, are beetles.
Beetles of one group having the front of the head produced into a
snoutlike structure, as in the genus <i>Curculio</i>, <a href="#fig55">fig. 55</a>, are called weevils
or snout beetles. This group has maggot-like larvae and contains many
of our worst pests, such as the plum curculio, cotton boll weevil, alfalfa
weevil, and clover weevil. Bizarre and striking forms occur in many
beetle groups, notably among the scarab and long-horn beetles. The
largest in Illinois is the rhinoceros beetle, <i>Dynastes tityus</i> (Linnaeus);
the males (one shown on the cover of this circular) have long projections
on both head and thorax; the larvae live in rotten wood.</p>
<p>Tree-boring beetle larvae are destructive to many orchard, ornamental,
and native trees. These include chiefly the round-headed borers,
adults of which are long-horn beetles; flat-headed borers, adults of
which are metallic wood borers; and engraver or shot-hole types, adults
of which are small and bullet shaped and are called bark beetles.</p>
<p>In a few families of beetles, both the adults and larvae are fitted
for aquatic life. Well known among these are the shining whirligig
beetles.</p>
<h4 id="c48">Hymenoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Bees, Wasps, Ants, Sawflies</span></h4>
<p>Insects typically with two pairs of wings; antennae
of various lengths; chewing mouthparts;
without tails. A typical member of this group is
the wasp <i>Vespula maculata</i> (Linnaeus), <a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>.
Many adult members of the group are atypical in
that they lack wings; these include all the true
ants, <a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>, which are without wings except for the sexual forms
produced at the time of the nuptial flights. Forms of one species,
<i>Lasius interjectus</i> Mayr, are shown in <a href="#fig58">fig. 58</a>. The wings, when developed,
are without scales; the venation is much less extensive than
in the Neuroptera; and the hind wings differ in shape and size from
the front wings. The young stages of the Hymenoptera are caterpillar-like
or grublike, entirely different from the adults.</p>
<p>This very large order includes such well-known forms as the
bees, as well as the wasps and the ants, mentioned above. In addition,
it includes the sawflies, whose caterpillar-like larvae are extensive
defoliators of a large number of native and cultivated plants and
shrubs; the large and varied groups of parasitic wasps that exert
great influence in the natural control of a tremendous number of other
insects; and a large number of gall-making wasps, whose galls are
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
especially conspicuous on oak trees. A parasitic wasp of the genus
<i>Opius</i> is shown in <a href="#fig59">fig. 59</a>. The parasitic wasps are extremely diverse
in size, shape, and habits. They range in size between 0.02 and 2.0
inches.</p>

<h4 id="c49">Mecoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Scorpionflies</span></h4>
<p>Insects typically with two similar pairs of delicate
wings, each wing with a network of veins. In repose
the wings are laid either tentlike over the
back or almost flat. The mouthparts are fitted for chewing and usually
are lengthened into a beaklike structure, as in <i>Panorpa chelata</i> Carpenter,
<a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a>. The larvae, seldom found, live in damp woods. The
adults of most winged species occurring in Illinois are about 0.5 inch
long. They are active in early summer in shady woods, flying through
the undergrowth. Adults of the genus <i>Boreus</i> are smaller and they
have very short, veinless wings. They emerge in the winter and early
spring; these little metallic black insects often hop around on late
winter snow. In certain genera, the adult male genitalia form a bulb-like
structure at the end of the body, as in <a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a>. This structure is
harmless but, because it resembles a scorpion&rsquo;s sting, insects of these
genera are given the name scorpionflies.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c50">Trichoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Caddisflies</span></h4>
<p>Insects with two pairs of wings, poorly developed
mouthparts of the chewing type, and long antennae;
without tails on the posterior end of the body.
In repose, the wings are held rooflike over the body and have only a
moderate number of longitudinal veins, which are not connected by
crossveins into any resemblance of a network. Neither body nor wings
are covered with scales. The larvae are wormlike and they live in
streams, ponds, and lakes. Many of them build cases of sticks, stones,
or sand and move about with only the front end of the body protruding
from the case. When disturbed, the larvae withdraw completely into
the cases and are then very difficult to see. The adult fly and larva of
<i>Rhyacophila fenestra</i> Ross illustrate this order, figs. <a href="#fig61">61</a> and <a href="#fig62">62</a>. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
many aquatic situations, caddisflies are the predominant small animal
life and are an important factor in fish food economy. Also, they are
stream pollution indicators.</p>

<h4 id="c51">Lepidoptera
<br /><span class="hst">Butterflies, Moths</span></h4>
<p>Insects typically with two pairs of wings, with
long antennae, and with mouthparts forming a
long sucking tube. The body and wings are covered
with a dense mass of scales, which are characteristic
of this order, <a href="#fig63">fig. 63</a>. The young are known as caterpillars
or grubs. The larval stage in this order is well exemplified by the

frugiperda</i> (Smith), <a href="#fig64">fig. 64</a>. Some other larvae are hairy; still others
are sluglike.</p>

also a very large number that are especially injurious to agriculture.
These include such species as the codling moth, cabbage moth, butterflies,
the entire cutworm group, and a host of others. In addition, the
various clothes moths, which are a constant source of loss to householders,
and various species of meal moths, which cause tremendous
damage to stored grain every year, are members of this order.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>In one group of moths, there are clear &ldquo;windows&rdquo; on the wings,
but these are always surrounded by areas or lines of scales. A few
species of the Lepidoptera are very odd in having wingless females.
Examples are the bagworms and some of the cankerworms. In these
species, however, the body of the female is densely clothed with scales,
which will serve to identify her as one of the Lepidoptera.</p>
<p>The habits of Lepidoptera larvae are very diverse. Most of these
larvae are leaf eaters, but some bore into trunks of trees and stems
of herbaceous plants. Some of the small ones mine within leaf tissue,
others live in the ground, where they eat roots, and a few are aquatic,
living in clear, rapidly flowing streams.</p>

<br /><span class="hst">Flies, Mosquitoes, and Their Allies</span></h4>
<p>Insects with only one pair of wings, each wing
with a limited number of veins. Other characters
of the order, including antennae and mouthparts,
are extremely varied. Most immature stages are
wormlike or maggot-like. They live in protected
situations, such as within the tissues of a plant, in
water, in leaf mold, or in the tissues of animals. A typical life cycle
is that shown for the house fly, <i>Musca domestica</i> Linnaeus, <a href="#fig65">fig. 65</a>.
The ubiquitous house fly is undoubtedly the best known representative
of this order. It is also one of the most persistent and dangerous
insect pests, being a possible carrier of many diseases.</p>

pair of wings; the pale, maggot-like larva is without legs; the darker, egg-shaped
puparium contains the pupal or quiescent stage. Length of adult 0.2 inch. (Drawing
by Alice Ann Prickett.)</p>
</div>
<p>Mosquitoes, punkies, black flies, and horse flies are likewise well
known members of this order. In addition to economic forms, the order
Diptera includes midges, crane flies, bee flies, robber flies, bluebottle
flies, and a great assortment of other kinds of insects. Interesting
are the bee flies, which mimic other insects such as honey bees, bumble
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
bees, and wasps to an extent that wins them immunity from the
attention of many beginning collectors.</p>
<h4 id="c53">Siphonaptera
<br /><span class="hst">Fleas</span></h4>
<p>Wingless insects that evolved from folding-wing
insects; conspicuously flattened from side to side;
with stout spiny legs, and with numerous spines
over the body; without conspicuous antennae or tails or a forked
posterior appendage like that of the springtails; usually hard; ranging
in color from yellowish brown to almost black.</p>
<p>The human flea, <i>Pulex irritants</i> Linnaeus, and a widespread Illinois
rat flea, <i>Nosopsyllus fasciatus</i> (Bosc), are shown in <a href="#fig66">fig. 66</a>.</p>
<p>All the fleas, which feed on the blood of birds and other animals,
have sucking mouthparts. They are powerful jumpers. The young
stages are slender, white larvae, <a href="#fig67">fig. 67</a>, which live in the nests of
various animals; these larvae are seldom collected. The fleas are found
on the animals themselves or around their nests. Several species of
fleas, including the cat and dog flea, the human flea, and the rat fleas,
attack man. One of the rat fleas, <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i> (Rothschild) is
the common transmitter of the organism causing bubonic plague.</p>

<h2 id="c54"><span class="small">RELATIVES OF INSECTS</span></h2>
<p>There are many small animals that belong to the same general
group as insects and that are frequently collected with them. Spiders,
centipedes, and amphipods are a few of many examples of such animals.
Together with insects, they form the animal phylum called
Arthropoda, characterized by having segmented bodies and jointed
legs. A brief description is included here of the common groups of
these insect relatives found in Illinois.</p>
<h4 id="c55">Isopoda
<br /><span class="hst">Sowbugs, Pillbugs</span></h4>
<p>Convex, many-legged animals having conspicuous
antennae; several of the posterior segments short
and joined rather closely to form an abdomen. Of
the Illinois forms, about one-half are aquatic, living
in streams and ponds. The others live in terrestrial situations
that are humid and dark. They are frequently found under boards
and in soil in greenhouses. One species of this group is <i>Armadillidium
vulgare</i> (Latreille), <a href="#fig68">fig. 68</a>, which possesses the ability to curl up in
a hard shell-like ball when disturbed. The isopods, relatives of crabs,
shrimps, and crayfish, belong to the general group known as crustaceans.
The crustacean groups are abundant in the ocean. In past
geologic ages, the early ancestors of such predominantly terrestrial
groups as insects and spiders resembled ancestors of the present
crustacean marine forms.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig68">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="309" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 68.&mdash;Isopoda. <i>Armadillidium vulgare</i>, a
common pillbug or sowbug (two views). Actual
length 0.3 inch. (Drawings from U.S.D.A.)</p>
</div>
<h4 id="c56">Amphipoda
<br /><span class="hst">Small Water Shrimps</span></h4>
<p>Humpbacked, many-legged crustaceans, <a href="#fig69">fig. 69</a>,
that are, unlike the isopods, flattened from side
to side like the fleas. They are all aquatic but are
seldom found swimming in open water; they prefer
to live in tangled masses of vegetation, under stones or logs, and
among debris in the very shallow water where it touches the bank.
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
These little shrimps are never more than about one-half inch long
and are frequently collected in large numbers along with aquatic
beetles. As is the case with the aquatic sowbugs, certain species of
amphipod shrimps occur in subterranean water sources and frequently
are found in wells. Most of these species are blind.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 70.&mdash;Scorpionida. <i>Centruroides vittatus</i>, the only scorpion known to occur
in Illinois. Actual length 2.0 inches. (Drawing by Alice Ann Prickett.)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h4 id="c57">Scorpionida
<br /><span class="hst">Scorpions</span></h4>
<p>Animals belonging to the spider group; characterized
by a pair of stout pincers at the end of each
front leg and a long tail-like extension of the abdomen
ending in a sharp sting, as in <i>Centruroides vittatus</i> (Say), <a href="#fig70">fig. 70</a>.
They have fairly long bodies and five pairs of legs each, including the
chelate pair. During the day they live under stones and bark, moving
about at night in search of insects and other small organisms on which
they prey. Many species occur in the Southwest; the range of one of
these extends as far northeastward as southwestern Illinois.</p>
<h4 id="c58">Pseudoscorpionida
<br /><span class="hst">Pseudoscorpions</span></h4>
<p>Animals belonging to the spider group; characterized
by a pair of stout pincers at the end of
the front legs, as in <i>Larca granulata</i> (Banks),
<a href="#fig71">fig. 71</a>. They have short, stout bodies, each with five pairs of legs
including the chelate front pair, but unlike the true scorpions they
have no tails or stings. The pseudoscorpions are sometimes found indoors
in old books, looking for their prey of small insects. They occur
in greater numbers in wooded areas.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c59">Phalangida
<br /><span class="hst">Daddy Longlegs, Harvestmen</span></h4>
<p>Spider-like forms, each animal with a short, round
body and four pairs of walking legs that in most
species are very long, <a href="#fig72">fig. 72</a>. They occur chiefly
in woods and may be found in numbers walking
over foliage and logs; they are often found on bluffs and in shady
places. They feed on decaying humus. A few Illinois forms that occur
chiefly on bark have considerably shorter legs than the species that
range more widely.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h4 id="c60">Araneida
<br /><span class="hst">Spiders</span></h4>
<p>Varied and well-known animals, each with four
pairs of walking legs and a body divided into a
cephalothorax (which combines the head and
thorax) and abdomen. The spiders present a tremendous variety of
shapes, some being round and fat, like the black widow, <i>Latrodectus
mactans</i> (Fabricius), <a href="#fig73">fig. 73</a>, others being long and slender, mimicking
ants. Others are crablike in shape; some that are long and slender
are extremely rapid in their movements. Spiders appear practically
everywhere. Certain species are domestic and are found only in houses.
In Illinois the only poisonous species of any importance are the black
widow spider, which is found in a variety of situations, and the recluse
spider, <i>Loxosceles reclusa</i> Gertsch &amp; Mulaik, which has been found in
house basements in southern Illinois.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c61">Acarina
<br /><span class="hst">Ticks, Mites</span></h4>
<p>Animals somewhat like the spiders but having no
marked division between the cephalothorax and
the abdomen. Each adult has four pairs of walking
legs, although an individual of the very young
stages has only three pairs. The mites are generally very minute and
seldom are seen by the beginning collector. They vary greatly in
general appearance. Many species are extremely destructive to stored
produce, to live domestic animals, and to many groups of plants.
Adults of the harvest mite and early stages of the chigger mite attack
man persistently.</p>

a red berry. Actual length 0.2
inch. (Drawing from U. S. D. A.)</p>
</div>
<p>Ticks are larger than mites. All the species feed on warm-blooded
animals, including birds and mammals. The commonest Illinois tick
is <i>Dermacentor variabilis</i> (Say), <a href="#fig74">fig. 74</a>, which transmits the organism
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
causing the often fatal disease called Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Although this disease occurs only infrequently in Illinois, hikers and
others exposed to ticks on excursions into the out-of-doors should
carefully examine their clothing and bodies and promptly remove
any ticks they find.</p>

<p>Elongate animals each having a distinct head
and a long, many-segmented body with two pairs
of legs on every segment. The commonest Illinois
representative is the large <i>Parajulus impressus</i> (Say), <a href="#fig75">fig. 75</a>, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
robust, cylindrical, reddish species commonly found in rotten logs or
moist leaf mold. Most species feed on decaying vegetable matter. A
few occasionally do considerable damage in greenhouses.</p>
<h4 id="c63">Chilopoda
<br /><span class="hst">Centipedes</span></h4>
<p>Elongate animals, similar in general appearance
to the millipedes but with only one pair of legs
on each body segment. Many species are predacious,
feeding on insects and other small animals in rotten logs
and humus. Most familiar to the city dweller is the house centipede,
<i>Scutigera forceps</i> Rafinesque, <a href="#fig76">fig. 76</a>; this is a common inhabitant of
dark places in houses, where it runs about with incredible speed in
search of the small insects upon which it feeds. Other species may
be encountered under boards and stones in gardens, <a href="#fig77">fig. 77</a>. Some
Illinois centipedes found in woody or rocky situations are 2 inches
or more long. No chilopod group in this state is dangerous to human
beings, but to the south occur centipedes nearly a foot long that may
inflict serious bites.</p>
<h2 id="c64"><span class="small">THE STATE INSECT COLLECTION</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig78">
<img src="images/p31d.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="467" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 78.&mdash;The Natural Resources Building. This building, on the campus of
the University of Illinois, is the home of the Illinois Natural History Survey and
houses the state insect collection on the second floor of the west wing. (Photograph

</div>
<p>Illinois is one of the very few states that maintain a large research
insect collection. This collection is under the care and guidance
of the Section of Faunistic Surveys and Insect Identification of the
Illinois Natural History Survey. It is housed in the west part of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
fireproof Natural Resources Building on the University of Illinois
campus at Urbana, <a href="#fig78">fig. 78</a>. Begun about 1880, the collection has grown
steadily until now it is the most extensive representative collection
of the insect fauna of any state in the nation. The collection consists
of over 5,500,000 specimens of insects housed in steel cabinets, <a href="#fig79">fig. 79</a>.
The pinned collection includes about 750,000 specimens in trays. The
collection preserved in alcohol contains over 3,500,000 insects including
not only a great number of valuable adult insects but also a very
useful collection of immature insects. The slide collection contains
nearly 250,000 specimens mounted as permanent microscopic preparations.
The papered and boxed material comprises more than 1,000,000
specimens of dried insects.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig79">
<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="557" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 79.&mdash;A view of the main insect collection room of the Illinois Natural
History Survey. In the steel cabinets and hardwood trays shown here are arranged
pinned insect specimens. Similar cabinets contain material in liquid preservative.
Adjoining this collection room are offices and laboratories of the Section of
Faunistic Surveys and Insect Identification, where records of insect distribution
and habits are kept on file.</p>
</div>
<p>The most important use of the collection is for identification of
insects known to damage crops, stored grains, and household articles,
or to threaten human health. Important also is its use as a storehouse
of information regarding the ecology, host relationships, and distribution
of Illinois insects.</p>
<p>So large is the field of insect classification that many important
gaps exist in our knowledge of the Illinois fauna. For maximum
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
usefulness, the collection should contain a complete representation
of the Illinois insect fauna, supplemented with as much additional
North American material as can be obtained. This additional comparison
material is frequently necessary to evaluate correctly the
species occurring in the state. It is estimated that there are about
20,000 different species of insects in Illinois and 150,000 in North
America. The collection contains representatives of over 15,000 Illinois
species, and a great many other North American species useful
as comparison material in the identification of Illinois forms.</p>
<p>Gifts to the collection of well-prepared material are greatly appreciated.
Many of those already received have made vital contributions
to the collection and added valuable records to the Natural
History Survey files of insect distribution.</p>
<h2 id="c65"><span class="small">REPORTS ON ILLINOIS INSECTS</span></h2>
<p>As a result of the accumulation of material and information in
the faunistic collection, the Illinois Natural History Survey has published
a number of reports dealing with various groups of insects
and other animals in Illinois; other reports in this series are being
prepared or planned. These reports are designed primarily for use of
the advanced student in zoology and entomology. They contain information
regarding the characteristics, habits, and distribution of the
various species in the state, keys for their identification, and illustrations
to assist in diagnosis of the structures used in identification.
Because of their great abundance in both species and numbers, and
their importance as pests, insects have been studied extensively and
much has been written about them.</p>
<p>The following reports of Illinois insects and their relatives have
been published by the Illinois Natural History Survey. Those marked
&ldquo;out of print&rdquo; are unavailable at the Survey, but may be consulted at
libraries or obtained from book dealers. Interested persons may obtain

<h2 id="c67"><span class="small">HOW TO SHIP SPECIMENS</span></h2>
<p>Specimens which the collector is unable to name may be sent to
specialists or entomological museums for identification. Names and
addresses of specialists can be furnished by agricultural agents,
teachers, or museum curators. The arrangements under which these
specialists will undertake the work vary, but experts often will study
well preserved and labeled collections in return for duplicate specimens
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
which they may keep. However, the identification of many
insects is so difficult and laborious that rapid service is not always to
be expected by collectors sending in material.</p>
<p>Specimens need special preparation and care to guard against
breakage if they are to be shipped to a specialist.</p>
<p>See that all pins used in mounting specimens are thrust securely
into the cork on the bottom of the box. Thrust extra pins of the same
height in each corner, and over the whole lay a piece of thin cardboard
that has been cut to fit the inside of the box snugly; then place
over this a layer of cotton wool or cellucotton thick enough to press
firmly against the cardboard when the top is closed. Wrap the box
in paper and then pack it in a larger box, protected on all sides by a
layer of excelsior or crumpled paper at least 2 inches thick.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
